    <h1>About IGsnitched</h1>
    <p>Welcome to IGsnitched – your ultimate ally in the pursuit of clarity and accountability on Instagram. We know how it feels to wonder who’s lurking in the shadows, dropping sneaky follows and unfollows, or changing their bio like there’s no tomorrow. That’s why we built IGsnitched: to give you the receipts you deserve, without the headache of logging in or connecting your own account.</p>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>IGsnitched was created to empower individuals with insights into public Instagram activity. Whether you’re keeping tabs on a partner, watching over a brand, or simply satisfying your curiosity, our tools provide clear, concise reports delivered with a sprinkle of sass. We believe transparency shouldn’t be a luxury – it should be a right.</p>
    <h2>Why “Snitch”?</h2>
    <p>“Snitch” might sound cheeky, but we embrace it with pride. Our service pulls back the curtain on IG behavior that would otherwise remain hidden. We don’t judge – we just deliver the facts (and maybe a little side-eye from Brad Mode).</p>
    <h2>Meet Brad Mode</h2>
    <p>If you haven’t met Brad Mode yet, you’re in for a treat. Think of it as our alter ego: part detective, part comedian. Brad Mode transforms raw data into playful commentary, because sometimes the truth needs a little spice.</p>
    <h2>Stay Connected</h2>
    <p>We’re constantly evolving and adding new features. Follow us on social media and sign up for updates to be the first to know when we launch new tools, features, or special promotions. If you have feedback or feature requests, we’d love to hear from you at <a href="mailto:admin@igsnitched.com">admin@igsnitched.com</a>.</p>
    <p>Thanks for joining us on this petty journey. Here’s to transparency, receipts, and keeping a watchful eye – with humor.</p>
