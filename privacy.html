    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. IGsnitched collects only the information necessary to provide our servicesâ€”primarily, the public Instagram usernames you choose to monitor.</p>
    <p>We do not collect or store your Instagram login credentials. Our tools interact only with publicly available information. Your reports, preferences and any optional contact information (such as your email address for alerts) are stored securely and never shared with third parties.</p>
    <p>We may use third-party services (such as analytics and email providers) to enhance our services. These providers have access only to the limited data they need to perform their functions and are bound by confidentiality obligations.</p>
    <p>By using IGsnitched, you consent to this Privacy Policy. We may update this policy from time to time; any changes will be posted on this page. Continued use of the service after changes become effective means you agree to the revised policy.</p>
